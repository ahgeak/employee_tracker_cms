# employee_tracker_cms

## Description

A command-line application that manages a company's employee database. This project helps the user keep track of employees, departments, and roles via tables. Each table has the option to be added to and if an employee needs to update their role, the user can do that. Through this program I clearned how to use mySQL to create, update, and display tables within the command line and thorugh code. I also used Inquirer to gather data from the user to be inserted into the the database.
